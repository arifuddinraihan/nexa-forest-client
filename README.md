### Why And How (Tour of this Web-site)?

**1. Programming Hero (An online School of Programming world) has provided me an assignment to make an Service Provider Website.**
 
**2. They Guided me through how the website should work.**
 
**3. First, I have Created an environment for this `Single Page Application` Website by using- npm-React.**
 
**4. Then I selected a theme from DaisyUI theme Generator, which is a Tailwind CSS based library.**
 
**5. For Hero Section in Homepage I have used `LottieFiles Player` which you can see in a link provided above.**
 
**6. By using Dynamic Route from `React Router` I have made this Application super-fast.**
 
**7. `Toastify` is another beautiful React toast library used in this website, with this you can show next level notifications in your website- Alerts!**
 
**8. I have made this website super responsive by the Power of `TailwindCSS` Framework and `DaisyUI` library.**
 
**9. For showing `Dynamic link` and `pages` I have used `loader` & `useLoader` in components along with dynamic link format using `{params}` and `/:id`.**
 
**10. And `Context API` has made it easier for me to pass the data down to the deepest child element, super duper helpful.**

**11. On this project I have implemented `Google Firebase Authentication` this has made my website secure as I can monitor who has visited this website. Along with this website analytics can be used via this system.**

**12. For the services and details, I have hosted some real data and stored them in `MongoDB`, a free platform for hosting entry level data**

**13. Then I have added a `React Environment Variable` to secure the API key which i got from Firebase**

**14. Created a `Vercel Configuration file` to set the route data file at vercel website.**

**15. I have added most beautiful and on-demand `DARK MODE` to this website, thanks a lot to `Tailwind.CSS` for such superb feature.**

**16. Also I have added some conditional renders, Navbar user render, Email-Password wrong render.**

**17. `Private Route` is a system from where if your not a valid user, you can not access that particular page, has been applied in this project.**

**18. [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) was fun when I applied automatic picture movement.**

**19. [react-photo-view](https://react-photo-view.vercel.app/en-US) another beautiful photo preview component make my service cover more playable.**

**20. I have also added service and reviews by descending order by using mongodb sort() method**
